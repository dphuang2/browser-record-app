<h1> Rewind Privacy Policy </h1>

<p>Privacy is extremely valuable and we deeply understand privacy concerns in our
    modern digital world.</p>

<p>Rewind does not store any personally identifiable information in its
    databases. All persisted data is impossible to link to an identity.</p>

<p>The only customer data that Rewind needs to store is serialized
    information regarding customer interactions such as mouse movement, mouse
    clicks, page loads, and page contents. To link customers and their interaction data,
    each customer is tagged with a 100% anonymous ID. </p>

<p>The only thing that Rewind stores for each merchant is their shop name and
    recurring charge id. And the only permissions we request are access to read and
    write script tags.</p>
