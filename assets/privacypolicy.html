    <h1> Rewind Privacy Policy </h1>

    <p>Privacy is extremely valuable and we deeply understand privacy concerns in our
        modern digital world.</p>

    <p>Rewind does not store any personally identifiable information in its
        databases. All persisted data is impossible to link to an identity.</p>

    <p>The only customer data that Rewind needs to store is information regarding
        customer interactions such as mouse movement, mouse clicks, page loads, and
        page contents. Each visiting customer is tagged with an 100% anonymous ID</p>

    <p>The only thing that Rewind stores for each merchant is their shop name and
        recurring charge ID. The only permissions we request are access to read and
        write script tags.</p>
