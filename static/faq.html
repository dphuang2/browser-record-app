            <li>
                Loopr is extremely cheap compared to similar alternatives.
                We offer a transparent pricing plan with no additional bells
                and whistles that you have to pay for. Everything is included.
            </li>

            <li>
                Loopr values privacy. We only collect the necessary
                information that will allow Loopr to function. We do not
                track or identify any customers and merchants.
            </li>

            <li>
                Loopr is high quality. Our application is meticulously
                engineered to give you high quality playback functionality, a
                quick and snappy user experience, and a well-designed user
                interface at an extremely affordable price.
            </li>

            <li>
                Loopr is easy to install and uninstall. Loopr only installs
                a single script tag to your shop. This script tag is
                automatically removed when you remove Loopr from your shop.
                No need for theme modifications or additional setup steps.
                Just click install and you are good to go!

        <b>
            <li>How do I install Loopr?</li> <br>
        </b>

        No additional setup is needed after installing Loopr through the app
        store. <br> <br>

        <b>
            <li> Is Loopr GDPR compliant? </li> <br>
        </b>

        Yes. Loopr does not intentionally store any identifiable information
        so it is completely GDPR compliant. But due to Loopr's core
        functionality, it might unintentionally record identifiable
        information depending on your shop's interface. If this is not
        desired, please redact any identifiable information from your shop's
        interface. <br> <br>

        <b>
            <li> How many customer replays can I store per month? </li> <br>
        </b>
        Unlimited! Loopr is highly engineered to bring you the cheapest
        solution to high-quality pixel-perfect replays. <br> <br>

        <b>
            <li> Will Loopr leave bloat in my website? </li> <br>
        </b>
        The only thing that Loopr installs is a script tag. Script tags are
        automatically uninstalled with the app so no trace is left behind.
        <br> <br>

        <b>
            <li>Does Loopr record passwords from customers? </li> <br>
        </b>
        No. Loopr censors all inputs of type "password". <br> <br>

        <b>
            <li>What happens to my shop's replays when I uninstall Loopr?</li> <br>
        </b>
        We do not automatically delete any replays from our database. If you
        would like to delete replays from our database, please contact
        loopr.the.app@gmail.com.
