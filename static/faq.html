    <h1>Rewind Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <ul>
        <b>
            <li> Is Rewind GDPR compliant? </li> <br>
        </b>

        Yes. Rewind does not store any identifiable information so it is
        completely GDPR compliant. <br> <br>

        <b>
            <li> How many customer replays can I store per month? </li> <br>
        </b>
        Unlimited! Rewind is highly engineered to bring you a powerful yet
        cheap analytical tool. <br> <br>

        <b>
            <li> Will Rewind leave bloat in my website? </li> <br>
        </b>
        The only thing that Rewind installs is a script tag. Script tags are
        automatically uninstalled with the app so no trace is left behind.

        <b>
            <li>Does Rewind record passwords from customers? </li> <br>
        </b>
        No. Rewind censors all inputs of type "password". <br> <br>
