        <b>
            <li>What makes Rewind different from other recording apps?</li> <br>
        </b>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Rewind is extremely cheap compared to similar alternatives.
                We offer a transparent pricing plan with no additional bells
                and whistles that you have to pay for. Everything is included.
            </li>

            <li>
                Rewind values privacy. We only collect the necessary
                information that will allow Rewind to function. We do not
                track or identify any customers and merchants.
            </li>

            <li>
                Rewind is high quality. Our application is meticulously
                engineered to give you high quality playback functionality, a
                quick and snappy user experience, and a well-designed user
                interface at an extremely affordable price.
            </li>

            <li>
                Rewind is easy to install and uninstall. Rewind only installs
                a single script tag to your shop. This script tag is
                automatically removed when you remove Rewind from your shop.
                No need for theme modifications or additional setup steps.
                Just click install and you are good to go!
            </li>
        </ol> <br>

        <b>
            <li>How do I install Rewind?</li> <br>
        </b>

        No additional setup is needed after installing Rewind through the app
        store. <br> <br>

        <b>
            <li> Is Rewind GDPR compliant? </li> <br>
        </b>

        Yes. Rewind does not store any identifiable information so it is
        completely GDPR compliant. <br> <br>

        <b>
            <li> How many customer replays can I store per month? </li> <br>
        </b>
        Unlimited! Rewind is highly engineered to bring you a powerful yet
        cheap analytical tool. <br> <br>

        <b>
            <li> Will Rewind leave bloat in my website? </li> <br>
        </b>
        The only thing that Rewind installs is a script tag. Script tags are
        automatically uninstalled with the app so no trace is left behind.
        <br> <br>

        <b>
            <li>Does Rewind record passwords from customers? </li> <br>
        </b>
        No. Rewind censors all inputs of type "password". <br> <br>

        <b>
            <li>What happens to my shop's replays when I uninstall Rewind?</li> <br>
